<p>Post, comment, vote, message… to see and share what’s happening nearby in Pokémon Go!</p>
<p>All posts are location-based, and the app uses your location so you can see nearby posts (within the radius you set).</p>
<p>View posts on the Map or in List view. Comment and upvote good posts; ignore or downvote bad ones.</p>
<p>You can also search by keyword, like "Pikachu" or "Help," and filter by interests (keywords you can set in your profile), certain users you follow, most recent posts, etc.</p>
<p>If you’re in an area without any posts yet, you can lead that area and be the first to post!</p>
<p>This app is not affiliated with Pokémon Go, Niantic, The Pokémon Company, or Nintendo.</p>
